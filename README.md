The files in this repository are a controller designed to interact with a 3rd party exoskeleton. 
The controller uses a KNN classifier to operate the exoskeleton after a brief training period.
The controller file also includes scripts used for data taking and analysis of the EMG signals during use of the exoskeleton.
